# bacterial_insertion_crispr_site_checker
A faster implementation of the string search for the check of the insertion elements and the CRISPR sites if present in the genome string and then clip those insertion sites and get a clean genome. a bacterial insertion element scannner based on the string search algorithm, it will check for the mentioned insertion element pattern and then clip that pattern and will stitch the genome devoid of the insertion elements.It will give you directly the fasta, you can also write the fasta. I am making a insertion element package and associating that to the microbiomes. You can also mention the CRISPR sites and to remove those from the genome. I also implemented a parallel support.
